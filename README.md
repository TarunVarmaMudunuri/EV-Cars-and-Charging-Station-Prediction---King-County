**Introduction**

**Market at a Glance**
Climate change and the rising concern over greenhouse gas emissions have led to increased focus on sustainable solutions in the transportation sector. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that transportation is the largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 29% of the total. This project is framed within the context of significant policy and industry shifts, including the Biden administration's infrastructure deal prioritizing clean energy and the growing commitment of states like Washington and California to mandate electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 and 2035, respectively.

As automakers like Ford, GM, and Volvo plan to go fully electric within the next decade, the demand for EVs is expected to surge, raising the question of how existing charging infrastructure can support this influx.

**Business Case**
To support the growing EV market, the Washington Department of Transportation has earmarked $8 million for charging infrastructure development from July 2021 to June 2023. This presents a lucrative opportunity for EV charging companies to invest in Washington State, benefiting from government funding while positioning themselves to meet the rising demand for chargers.

**Business Problem & Goal**
To strategically position EV chargers, it is crucial to model and predict the demand for EVs across Washington's counties. This project aims to use time series modeling to identify the top three counties with the highest demand for EVs and the greatest potential for charger deployment. This analysis will focus on the top 10 counties in Washington with the most new EV purchases.

**OBTAIN**
The analysis is based on electric vehicle title and registration activity data provided by Washington State. This data will be used to track the number of EVs in each county over time. Additionally, charging infrastructure data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will be analyzed to identify counties with high potential for successful charger investments.

**SCRUB**
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps will be performed to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and preparing the datasets for time series modeling.

**EXPLORE**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to uncover trends, patterns, and insights within the data. Visualizations and statistical analyses will help identify key factors influencing EV demand and charger needs in each county.

**MODEL**
Time series models will be developed to forecast the future demand for electric vehicles in the selected counties. Various modeling techniques will be compared to identify the most accurate and reliable predictors.

**INTERPRET**
The results of the time series models will be interpreted in conjunction with current charging infrastructure data to pinpoint the top three counties that offer the greatest potential for investment in EV chargers.

**Conclusions/Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, recommendations will be made for the top three counties in Washington where EV charger investments should be prioritized. These recommendations will consider both the projected demand for EVs and the existing charging infrastructure, ensuring strategic deployment of resources.
